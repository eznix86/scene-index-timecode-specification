# Scene Index Timecode (SIT) Format

## Overview

The Scene Index Timecode (SIT) format is a simple, text-based format for describing the structure of video content. It allows for precise timing of different segments within a video, such as intros, main content, and credits.

## Usage

SIT files can be used for various purposes, including:

- Identifying different segments of a video for automated processing
- Skipping intros, recaps, or credits in video playback software
- Analyzing the structure of TV episodes or movies
- Inserting advertisements at appropriate points in a video stream
